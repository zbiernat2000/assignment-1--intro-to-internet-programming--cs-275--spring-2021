         Jeremiah is Godspeed You Black Emperor!’s prophet. The Hebrew emblazoned in dirty copper on the cover of their Slow Riot for New Zero Kanada EP belongs to him:<br />
          tohu-va-bohu, it reads: void and waste. The lengthy passage on the sleeve of that EP is lifted from his book. Blase Bailey Finnegan III, the Providence street preacher<br /> 
          whose rantings appear on the two first Godspeed You Black Emperor! releases, is his avatar.The music of Godspeed, for all its bombast and lament, extends Jeremiah’s<br />
           ministry into a new millennium. Preaching in a vocabulary drawn from Boston hardcore, in a spidery array of radical leftist rhetoric, Godspeed You Black Emperor! have delivered a blistering (albeit politically imprecise) homily on the new world order.
